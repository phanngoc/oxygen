# Oxygen Protocol Documentation

## Overview

Oxygen is a decentralized finance (DeFi) prime brokerage service built on the Solana blockchain. It enables users to lend, borrow, and trade with leverage while maintaining complete control over their funds through a non-custodial architecture.

## Key Features

- **Non-custodial architecture**: Users maintain control of their funds at all times
- **Cross-collateralization**: Use your entire portfolio as collateral, reducing liquidation risks
- **Yield generation**: Earn yield on deposited assets
- **Lending & borrowing**: Lend assets to earn interest or borrow against your collateral
- **Leveraged trading**: Trade with leverage directly from your portfolio
- **Market-based pricing**: Order book model instead of preset markets that require manual adjustments
- **100% on-chain**: All operations occur on the Solana blockchain for maximum transparency
